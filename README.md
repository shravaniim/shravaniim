Here's a project on **Credit Card Fraud Detection** using ML in Python
Fraud Detection model based on anonymized credit card transactions
It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.

***Getting started
Get the code from the repository
git clone https://github.com/sagnikghoshcr7/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection.git 
Download the dataset that will be used to train a transaction classifier. Unzip it and put the content (creditcard.csv) under main folder (Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection)

Install required python packages if previously not installed

Finally run on Jupyter Notebook and enjoy 😉
